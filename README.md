**Memory Game** is a Light & Sound Memory game to apply for CodePath's SITE Program. 

Submitted by: Kate Delaney

Time spent: 2 hours spent in total

Link to project: https://glitch.com/edit/#!/light-and-sound1

## Required Functionality

The following **required** functionality is complete:

* [ ] Game interface has a heading (h1 tag), a line of body text (p tag), and four buttons that match the demo app
* [ ] "Start" button toggles between "Start" and "Stop" when clicked. 
* [ ] Game buttons each light up and play a sound when clicked. 
* [ ] Computer plays back sequence of clues including sound and visual cue for each button
* [ ] Play progresses to the next turn (the user gets the next step in the pattern) after a correct guess. 
* [ ] User wins the game after guessing a complete pattern
* [ ] User loses the game after an incorrect guess

The following **optional** features are implemented:

* [ ] Any HTML page elements (including game buttons) has been styled differently than in the tutorial
* [ ] Buttons use a pitch (frequency) other than the ones in the tutorial
* [ ] More than 4 functional game buttons
* [ ] Playback speeds up on each turn
* [ ] Computer picks a different pattern each time the game is played
* [ ] Player only loses after 3 mistakes (instead of on the first mistake)
* [ ] Game button appearance change goes beyond color (e.g. add an image)
* [ ] Game button sound is more complex than a single tone (e.g. an audio file, a chord, a sequence of multiple tones)
* [ ] User has a limited amount of time to enter their guess on each turn

The following **additional** features are implemented:

- [ ] List anything else that you can get done to improve the app!

## Reflection Questions
1. If you used any outside resources to help complete your submission (websites, books, people, etc) list them here. 
https://www.canva.com/colors/color-meanings/baby-blue/ - used to get the color of my background

2. What was a challenge you encountered in creating this submission (be specific)? How did you overcome it? (recommended 200 - 400 words) 
    One challenge I encountered was learning HTML, CSS, and JavaScript languages. I had never used any of 
  these languages before, but they were surprisingly easy to learn. I had seen HTML before, but I just 
  didn’t realize it at the time. The open tag and closing tag were described well in the instructions given 
  and after I read about them, it was intuitive to create the header, body text, and buttons in HTML 
  language. When it came to JavaScript, the language is very similar to programming languages I have 
  experience with (C and Python). Creating functions and global variables was second nature to me but 
  learning the syntax of the language was a little more difficult. Luckily, the instructions provided line by 
  line code so I could get the correct syntax. And finally, CSS was a language that was very new to me and 
  didn’t resemble any other language I had worked with at first. However, after reading the tips on how to 
  program in CSS, it became clear to me that you essentially create a function for every piece of content 
  that you want to style. Inserting new style functions was easily understood. However, the actual content 
  of those functions took a little more time to understand, but after reviewing the code given when you 
  create a new project in Glitch, I understood that you could code the font, colors, and background colors. 
  Most of the code on the CSS file I wouldn’t have been able to write on my own without the help of the 
  instructions given for this pre-work task. But I am now equipped with basic knowledge of CSS that I can
  use on future projects.

3. What questions about web development do you have after completing your submission? (recommended 100 - 300 words) 
    A question I have about web development is how long do programmers typically have to complete a 
  project of this complexity? Obviously, being a new programmer in all three languages slowed me down 
  in my development of this game, so how long would it take a professional to create this game? Also, 
  how often do people have to edit their websites? Is there something on a single website that can be 
  improved every day, or are there some days where people jump from site to site, improving multiple 
  sites in a day? I would think that most websites only need to be updated every week or so, but maybe 
  websites are changing all the time and I just don’t realize it. 

4. If you had a few more hours to work on this project, what would you spend them doing (for example: refactoring certain functions, adding additional features, etc). Be specific. (recommended 100 - 300 words) 
    If I had more time to work on this project, I would start improving would be adding additional features. 
  My HTML page did use different frequencies than the ones given in the tutorial, but I would like to 
  explore some of the other optional features listed above. First, I would implement an increase in the 
  speed of playback for every turn. To do so, I would simply minimize the clueHoldTime each round that a 
  clue is given. Then, I would begin creating more than four buttons and creating longer patterns so the 
  player could continue the game for a longer time. Maybe I could add a button somewhere in the middle 
  of the game to try and throw the player off. And finally, I would create more than one pattern so the 
  user can start and stop the game several times without having the same pattern repeated.
